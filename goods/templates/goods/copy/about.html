                            Founded in 2014, in the heart of Silicon Valley, our mission is to make it easier for people to find home furnishings that are aligned with their unique tastes. Today, Rare Door carries home decor from independent retailers in the Bay, enabling you to find that one of kind piece without having to wander from store to store, sifting through inventory. Better yet, once you’ve found that piece, you don’t have to be concerned about getting it home.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            So why the name ‘Rare Door'? Door is derived from d’or, which is French for gold. Let us introduce you to rare gold. More treasure, less hunting.

                             We know that once you find an item, getting it home can be a pain. That’s why we take care of the shipping for you. Once you purchase, we’ll call you and coordinate a delivery time that is convenient for you.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                             We do not offer returns because each piece is unique, and it is expected that vintage items have some wear. However, if you have questions about a particular item, feel free to contact us before purchasing.
