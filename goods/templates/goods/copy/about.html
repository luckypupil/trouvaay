                            The concept of Rare Door evolved out of our own frustrations with furnishing our homes. Our mission is to make it easier for people to find furniture that is aligned with their tastes and available locally. We curate furniture from independent retailers across the Bay Area, enabling you to find that special piece without wandering from store to store, sifting through inventory. Oh, and once you’ve found that piece, you don’t have to be concerned about getting it home.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            So why the name ‘Rare Door'? Door is derived from d’or, which is French for gold. Let us introduce you to rare gold.

                        <p>
                             We know the disappointment that comes with finding a great piece of furniture and then realizing that shipping cost more than the item itself. Even worse, sometimes you have to coordinate the delivery on your own. We want to remove all that hassle. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We charge $5 for small items, $65 for bulk items (not included in your item's list price)..
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After you’ve placed your order, we’ll call you and coordinate a delivery time that is convenient for you.
