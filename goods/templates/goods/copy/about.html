                            Our mission, which evolved out of our own frustrations with furnishing our homes, is to make it easier for people to find furniture locally that is aligned with their personal tastes. We curate furniture from independent retailers across the Bay Area, enabling you to find that special piece without having to wander from store to store siftiing through inventory. Oh, and once you’ve found that piece, you don’t have to be concerned about getting it home.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            So why the name ‘Rare Door'? Door is derived from d’or, which is French for gold. Let us introduce you to rare gold. 
                        </p>
                        <h4>
                            More treasure, less hunting.
                        </h4>

                        <p>
                             We know the disappointment that comes with finding a great piece of furniture and then realizing that shipping cost more than the item itself. Even worse, sometimes you have to coordinate the delivery on your own. We want to remove all that hassle. That’s why we have simple, 3 tier pricing for delivery: $25, $50, & $75 based on the size of the purchase.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After you’ve placed your order, we’ll call you and coordinate a delivery time that is convenient for you.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tab-pane text-editor" id="returns">
                        <p>
                             Our return policy varies based on each individual item and is listed at the bottom of each detailed product page.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since we want our customers to be happy with their purchase, we offer a '5-Day Discovery' period which give you the opportunity to touch, see, and feel the item in store, before it’s delivered to your door. If you change your mind cancel the order — no cost, no questions asked. If you still want it, do nothing and we’ll deliver it as scheduled.
                        </p>
